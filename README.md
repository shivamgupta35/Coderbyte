# 1) TreeConstructor(strArr)
Array Challenge
Have the function ArrayChallenge(strArr) take the array of strings stored in strArr, which will contain pairs of integers in the following format: (i1,i2), where i1 represents a child node in a tree and the second integer i2 signifies that it is the parent of i1. For example: if strArr is ["(1,2)", "(2,4)", "(7,2)"], then this forms the following tree:
which you can see forms a proper binary tree. Your program should, in this case, return the string true because a valid binary tree can be formed. If a proper binary tree cannot be formed with the integer pairs, then return the string false. All of the integers within the tree will be unique, which means there can only be one node in the tree with the given integer value.
Examples
Input: ["(1,2)", "(2,4)", "(5,7)", "(7,2)", "(9,5)"]
Output: true
Input: ["(1,2)", "(3,2)", "(2,12)", "(5,2)"]
Output: false


# 2) Front-end Challenge
We provided some simple JavaScript template code. Your goal is to modify the application so that you can properly toggle the button to switch between an ON state and an OFF state. When the button is on and it is clicked, it turns off and the text within it changes from ON to OFF and vice versa. Only replace the text within the DOM element, do not replace the entire DOM element. You are free to add classes and styles, but make sure you leave the element ID's as they are.


# 3) Back-end Challenge
In the PHP file, write a program to perform a GET request on the route https://coderbyte.com/api/challenges/json/age-counting which contains a data key and the value is a string which contains items in the format: key=STRING, age=INTEGER. Your goal is to count how many items exist that have an age equal to or greater than 50, and print this final value.
Example Input
{"data":"key=IAfpK, age=58, key=WNVdi, age=64, key=jp9zt, age=47"}
Example Output
2


# 4)String Challenge
Have the function StringChallenge(str) take the str parameter being passed and determine the largest number of unique characters that exists between a pair of matching letters anywhere in the string. For example: if str is "ahyjakh" then there are only two pairs of matching letters, the two a's and the two h's. Between the pair of a's there are 3 unique characters: h, y, and j. Between the h's there are 4 unique characters: y, j, a, and k. So for this example your program should return 4.

Another example: if str is "ghececgkaem" then your program should return 5 because the most unique characters exists within the farthest pair of e characters. The input string may not contain any character pairs, and in that case your program should just return 0. The input will only consist of lowercase alphabetic characters.
Examples
Input: "mmmerme"
Output: 3
Input: "abccdefghi"
Output: 0
